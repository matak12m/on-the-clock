I apologize for the quality of the recording. My personal laptop has broken down and as such, so for the lack of other options,
I had to use the computers in the library. Since I cannot download anything onto these computers, my only option for a recording
was though the Stream App on OneDrive. This, for some reason, only produces videos with around 1 frame per 3 seconds. 

The library computers also aren't equipped with a microphone, so I had to resort to just writing down a transcript. 

You can watch the video either though the uploaded video, or this link:

The video in the link has a transcript below it, but if you watch the video through the upload,
you can see the transcript here as well:

	
	First, we're taking a look at the map of the game. It consists of 9 squares, each representing a canvas screen. 
the player can move through these by walking to the edge of the screen, which will "teleport" them onto a different screen. 
In reality this will simply change what the canvas shows.

	Next, there is a mockup of the gameplay on desktop. The player can move across the screen to the left to enter the tile
 with a friends house. the Friend isn't there at the moment, so by manually changing the Clock beneath the canvas, 
the player changes the time to a time of day when the friend is present. Walking up to the friend and interacting will 
change the text box, and give the player dialogue options to choose from. Here I tell the friend to come to the campsite 
at Evening. When we then change the time again to Evening, he friend disappears. but in reality he is at the campsite when 
we walk over there. Once it is no longer Evening, the Friend disappears to a different tile yet again.

	Now for the final part, a mockup of how the mobile controls will look. The player can choose the mobile/desktop 
version of the game through a form that appears when you enter the page. the form will only change how the UI looks.
 The mobile version has the clock on the left and button controls on the right.
