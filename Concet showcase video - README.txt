I apologize for the quality of the recording. My personal laptop has broken down and as such, so for the lack of other options,
I had to use the computers in the library. Since I cannot download anything onto these computers, my only option for a recording
was though the Stream App on OneDrive. This, for some reason, only produces videos with around 1 frame per 3 seconds. 

The library computers also aren't equipped with a microphone, so I had to resort to just writing down a transcript. 

You can watch the video either though the uploaded video, or this link:

The video in the link has a transcript below it, please access the video through it.

I apologize for the inconvenience.
